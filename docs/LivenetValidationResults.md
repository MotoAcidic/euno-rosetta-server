# Livenet Data API Validation Results

Rosetta CLI has been successfully executed with a fully synced EunoPay Rosetta Node.

This configuration was used in order to validate the Data API:
```json
{
 "network": {
  "blockchain": "EunoPay",
  "network": "livenet"
 },
 "online_url": "http://localhost:8080",
 "data_directory": "EunoPay-rosetta-server/data",
 "http_timeout": 10,
 "sync_concurrency": 8,
 "transaction_concurrency": 16,
 "tip_delay": 300,

 "construction": null,

 "data": {
  "historical_balance_disabled": false,
  "reconciliation_disabled": false,
  "inactive_discrepency_search_disabled": false,
  "balance_tracking_disabled": false,
  "end_conditions": {
    "index": 2500
  },
  "active_reconciliation_concurrency": 4,
  "inactive_reconciliation_concurrency": 4
 }
}	
```

which resulted in the following output:
